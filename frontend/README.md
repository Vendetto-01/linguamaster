# Word Wizard Frontend

This directory contains the React (TypeScript with Vite) frontend for the Word Wizard application. It serves as an Admin Panel for submitting new vocabulary words.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already).**
2.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Configure Environment Variables (Optional):**
    The frontend connects to the backend API. By default, it assumes the backend is running on `http://localhost:3001`.
    If your backend is running on a different URL, you can create a `.env` file in this `frontend` directory and set the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` variable:
    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://your-backend-api-url/api
    ```
    For example, if your backend is `http://localhost:3005/api`, set it accordingly.

## Running the Application

-   **Development mode (with auto-reloading and HMR):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically start on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port, but it might choose another if 5173 is busy). Check your terminal for the exact URL.

-   **Building for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command creates an optimized static build in the `dist` directory. These files can then be deployed to a static site hosting service like Render.com.

-   **Previewing the Production Build Locally:**
    After building, you can preview the production build:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```

## Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the TypeScript and React source code.
    -   `assets/`: Static assets like images, logos (e.g., `react.svg`).
    -   `components/`: Reusable React components (e.g., `WordSubmitForm.tsx`).
    -   `config/`: Configuration files (if any, beyond environment variables).
    -   `pages/`: Top-level page components (e.g., `AdminPage.tsx`).
    -   `services/`: Modules for API calls and other business logic (e.g., `apiClient.ts`, `wordService.ts`).
    -   `types/`: TypeScript type definitions (e.g., `word.types.ts`).
    -   `App.tsx`: Main application component that sets up routing/pages.
    -   `main.tsx`: Entry point that renders the React application.
    -   `App.css`, `index.css`: Global styles.
-   `public/`: Static assets that are copied directly to the build output (e.g., `vite.svg`, `favicon.ico`).
-   `dist/`: Production build output (generated by `npm run build`).
-   `.env`: Environment variables (ignored by Git).
-   `index.html`: Main HTML file for the Vite application.
-   `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.
-   `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`: TypeScript compiler options.
-   `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration file.

## Functionality

The current frontend provides an Admin Panel with a form to:
- Submit a single English vocabulary word.
- Upon submission, it calls the backend API.
- The backend processes the word (contacts Gemini API, saves to Supabase).
- The frontend displays the details of the newly added word entry returned by the backend.
